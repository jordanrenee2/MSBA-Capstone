Student Engagement and Career Outcomes Analysis
Project Overview

This project explores the relationship between student participation in co-curricular and career development activities and post-graduation career outcomes. Specifically, it examines whether engagement in activities such as volunteering, experiential learning, career center events, and career coaching appointments is associated with stronger career outcomes, including employment status, alignment with chosen career field, and income.

The goal of this analysis is to provide data-informed insights that can help institutions better understand which student engagement opportunities are most strongly associated with career success.
