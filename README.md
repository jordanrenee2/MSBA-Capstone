# Student Engagement and Career Outcomes Analysis

## Project Overview
This project examines the relationship between student participation in co-curricular and career development activities and post-graduation career outcomes. The analysis focuses on whether engagement in activities such as volunteering, experiential learning, career center events, and career coaching appointments is associated with improved career success.

Career success is measured using outcomes such as employment status, alignment with chosen career field, and income. The findings are intended to support data-informed decision-making around student programming and resource allocation.
