Progress: I have decided what my project will be and who my client is, I will start putting together a plan to piece together data stored in multiple sources, and come up with a schedule as far as what I should have done when.
Problems: N/A
Plans: 
- Figure out how to quantify "meaningful engagement"
- Figure out which students I will be examining- what should the sample size be, how should I randomly select
- Figure out how to track event attendance during the time that they were enrolled 
- Figure out which outcome to track (employment, salary, etc.)
Hours: None, this current week is the first week I will start working on it.
