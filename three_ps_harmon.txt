Progress:
    - Pulled both sets of data, met with a coworker to discuss how to combine the sets
Problems:
    - I need to meet with my manager (client) to discuss the proper steps I need to take so that I am able to use the data, however she is gone until February 18. I will meet with her as soon as possible to make sure I can start completing this project.
Plans:
    - I need to get as far as I can in setting up my code and making plans to assign variables, determine significance, etc. until I am able to deidentify and officially start using the data.
Hours: 2


February 8, 2026
Progress: Pulled the appropriate data, started making a plan.
Problems: 
    - One slight problem is that I need to meet with my manager (client) to discuss the proper steps so that I am able to utilize the data.
    - Another problem is that I need to use two different data sets, and there is no easy way to match respondents between both sets (such as student ID). I may have to use email, which is not best practice.
Plans:
    - I need to meet with my manager to determine the most appropriate way to deidentify the data and ensure I'm going through all of the proper steps to use the data. Unfortunately, she will be gone for another week, so in the mean time I just need to start drafting my code and making a plan to assign variables, finalize what I am measuring and how I am determining significance, etc.
Hours: 2

February 1, 2026

Progress: I met with Professor Connor to discuss my project, I reached out to a coworker to discuss how she thinks I should approach it.
Problems: Want to be sure that my project is best aligned for my desire to work internationally some day, and not that I'm just doing it because it's easiest.
Plans:
    - De-identify and pull data
    - Figure out outcome and event tracking
Hours: 2

January 25, 2026

Progress: I have decided what my project will be and who my client is, I will start putting together a plan to piece together data stored in multiple sources, and come up with a schedule as far as what I should have done when.
Problems: N/A
Plans: 
- Figure out how to quantify "meaningful engagement"
- Figure out which students I will be examining- what should the sample size be, how should I randomly select
- Figure out how to track event attendance during the time that they were enrolled 
- Figure out which outcome to track (employment, salary, etc.)
Hours: None, this current week is the first week I will start working on it.
